# Work Day Scheduler

## Purpose 
This work day scheduler is designed for employees with busy schedules who need a digital color coded planner to help manage time effectively. This allows users to add, save, and delete events from their daily schedule. In future updates, users will be able to set their own work hours and choose a 1 day or 5 day schedule layout.
